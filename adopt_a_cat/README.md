# AdoptACat

Welcome to the AdoptACat gem! With this gem, you will be able to access a list of cats from Anjellicle Cat Rescue, a local shelter in NYC. You may check out the cats and make an appointment by calling the shelter, or you may exit the program.

Please enter "bin/adopt" to run the program.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'adopt_a_cat'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install adopt_a_cat

## Usage

Enter "bin/adopt" to start the program. Take the time to check out all of the cats that are available - there are over 200! When asked to make an appointment, please type "yes" or "no" to respond to the prompt. If yes, you will receive Anjellicle Cat Rescue's contact information. If no, you will be asked if you'd like to see the list of cats again. If you no longer want to see the list of cats, enter "no" or "exit" and you will leave the shelter. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
